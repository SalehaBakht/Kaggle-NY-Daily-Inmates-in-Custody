# Kaggle-NY-Daily-Inmates-in-Custody

This folder contains the exploration into the NY Daily Inmates in Custody dataset found on Kaggle and NYC OpenData. This exploration includes progress reports, a final report, a slidedeck, and code. The code includes lines for the exploration as well as a portion to try some machine learning techniques on the data.

All files prefixed with 'Final' are the finished solutions and reports to the capstone. They include two pdf files (one of a document report and one of a presentation slidedeck) and one .ipynb file that has the initial exploration of the data and the future machine learning feature of the exploration.
